### <ins>[1: Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization Using Python](https://github.com/WayneNyariroh/StoreSales_Analysis)</ins>
Every business is highly dependent on its data to make better decisions for growth and success, data analysis plays an important role in helping different business entities to get an idea on their performance and any opportunities to increase gains and minimise losses. 
The objective was to gain valuable insights on the overall performance of the Store.
> Data was sourced from ***Kaggle***. <br>
> **Tools used**: Python, pandas, numpy, jupyter lab, matplotlib and seaborn. <br>
> **Activities**: Data processing, data cleaning, data querying and vizualization. <br>
> **Concepts explored**: Correlation, Pivoting and Indexing, Date Manipulation. <br>

Insights:<br>

### <ins>[2: Customer Retention: Performing a Cohort Analysis using Python](https://github.com/WayneNyariroh/customer-retention_cohortAnalysis/blob/main/RetentionAnalysis.ipynb)</ins>
Monitoring retention metrics is critical for a business to understand lifetime customer value and to quantify the efficacy of its marketing strategy and customer service program.
***Customer retention is when one of your buyers purchases from you again***.<br>
A business' customer retention rate compares the number of customers you have retained to your total number of customers during a certain period. You can use customer loyalty programs, customer feedback surveys, social media and additional incentives to improve your customer retention rate.<br>
>SuperStore dataset from ***Kaggle*** & it serves as a continuation of the [Exploratory Data Analysis Project](https://github.com/WayneNyariroh/StoreSales_Analysis) above<br>
> **Tools used**: Python, pandas, jupyter lab, matplotlib and seaborn. <br>
> **Activities**: Data processing, data cleaning, data querying, creating pivot tables, indexing, and vizualization. <br>
> **Concept explored:** Cohorts.<br>


Clients are assigned to a cohort based on the first time they appeared in the dataset i.e, the time of first order, then their behaviour monitored over a duration. Concept of Cohorts and Retention Analysis can be extended to various organizations and institutions; a private clinic can use it to observe returning patients or monitor appointment keeping.<br>

### <ins>[3: PowerBI Visualization Project](https://github.com/WayneNyariroh/StoreSales_PowerBI_Dashboard)</ins>

![PowerBI Dashboard](/visualization_output/DashboardScreenshot.png)

A simple and user-friendly dashboard that display annotations of each value and allows filtering on the visualizations and insights based on selected values, focusing on Revenue, Number of Sales and Profit to allow interactivity.<br>
